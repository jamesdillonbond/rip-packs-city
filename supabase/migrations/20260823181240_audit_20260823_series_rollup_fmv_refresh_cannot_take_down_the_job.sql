-- ── APPENDED 2026-08-24 AFTER RECOVERY — comment only, SQL untouched ─────────
-- ⚠ THIS FILE IS A RECOVERED CAPTURE, not a hand-authored migration. It was
-- applied to production via MCP and its .sql was reconstructed byte-exactly from
-- `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations.statements` by
-- `scripts/recover-fileless-migrations.mjs`. Committing it turned CI RED, because
-- `__tests__/migration-new-function-states-its-anon-exec-decision.test.ts` requires
-- every migration from its 20260817000000 CUTOFF forward to STATE an anon-execute
-- decision per public function it creates — and a capture of history states none.
--
-- The decision is stated here rather than by weakening that guard, and it was
-- MEASURED rather than assumed. Verified live 2026-08-24 with
-- `has_function_privilege` (never the acl text):
--   anon = false · authenticated = false · service_role = true · SECURITY DEFINER
--
-- ⚠ ONLY THIS COMMENT WAS ADDED. Not one SQL byte changed, so re-running the file
-- against production is still a no-op and the revert path it carries is intact.
-- It does mean the file no longer md5-matches prod's stored `statements`; that is
-- the deliberate cost of satisfying the guard honestly instead of exempting it.
-- ⚠ A REVOKE must NOT be added: `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` does not reset an
-- ACL, so one here would CHANGE production while presenting itself as a no-op.
-- anon-exec: unchanged — public.refresh_series_detail_rollup is SECURITY DEFINER and already revoked from PUBLIC, anon and authenticated (verified live 2026-08-24 by has_function_privilege).
--
-- Blast-radius fix for the 17:59 failure. Two separate problems, two fixes; the
-- other one (incremental refresh) is the companion migration.
--
-- PROBLEM: I folded refresh_edition_fmv_current() into this job as a bare
-- PERFORM. When it blew cron_heavy's 600 s ceiling the WHOLE job died — the
-- series rollup, which had been succeeding for hours and has 26 indexable pages
-- depending on it, went down with a table it does not need in order to run.
-- I coupled a brand-new component to a load-bearing one with no isolation.
--
-- FIX: the FMV rebuild runs inside its own BEGIN/EXCEPTION block. If it fails,
-- the series aggregates still refresh — from the PREVIOUS hour's
-- edition_fmv_current, which is exactly what a rollup is for.
--
-- ⚠ AND IT DOES NOT FAIL SILENTLY. The exception is recorded in the return value
-- and in pipeline_runs.extra, and `ok` is set to FALSE for the run. A job that
-- swallows a failure and reports ok=true is the silent-degradation class; the
-- point of catching here is to keep the pages served, not to hide anything.
--
-- REVERT: audit_20260823_series_rollup_refresh_drives_edition_fmv_current
-- (bare PERFORM, no guard).
