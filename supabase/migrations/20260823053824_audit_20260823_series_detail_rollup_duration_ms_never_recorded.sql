-- ── APPENDED 2026-08-24 AFTER RECOVERY — comment only, SQL untouched ─────────
-- ⚠ THIS FILE IS A RECOVERED CAPTURE, not a hand-authored migration. It was
-- applied to production via MCP and its .sql was reconstructed byte-exactly from
-- `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations.statements` by
-- `scripts/recover-fileless-migrations.mjs`. Committing it turned CI RED, because
-- `__tests__/migration-new-function-states-its-anon-exec-decision.test.ts` requires
-- every migration from its 20260817000000 CUTOFF forward to STATE an anon-execute
-- decision per public function it creates — and a capture of history states none.
--
-- The decision is stated here rather than by weakening that guard, and it was
-- MEASURED rather than assumed. Verified live 2026-08-24 with
-- `has_function_privilege` (never the acl text):
--   anon = false · authenticated = false · service_role = true · SECURITY DEFINER
--
-- ⚠ ONLY THIS COMMENT WAS ADDED. Not one SQL byte changed, so re-running the file
-- against production is still a no-op and the revert path it carries is intact.
-- It does mean the file no longer md5-matches prod's stored `statements`; that is
-- the deliberate cost of satisfying the guard honestly instead of exempting it.
-- ⚠ A REVOKE must NOT be added: `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` does not reset an
-- ACL, so one here would CHANGE production while presenting itself as a no-op.
-- anon-exec: unchanged — public.refresh_series_detail_rollup is SECURITY DEFINER and already revoked from PUBLIC, anon and authenticated (verified live 2026-08-24 by has_function_privilege).
--
-- series_detail_rollup.duration_ms has been NULL on every row since the table
-- was created, and the reason is a comparison that can never be true.
--
-- The refresh sets `computed_at = now()` (TRANSACTION start) and then stamps the
-- duration with `WHERE collection_id = ... AND computed_at >= v_t0`, where
-- v_t0 := clock_timestamp() taken INSIDE the loop. clock_timestamp() always runs
-- later than now() within the same transaction, so computed_at >= v_t0 is false
-- for every row it just wrote. The UPDATE matched nothing, every time.
--
-- This is the "a metric that cannot reach its clean value is not a metric"
-- shape: a per-collection timing column that reads NULL forever looks like
-- "not instrumented" rather than "instrument broken", so nobody chases it.
-- It matters more now that get_series_detail READS this table on every series
-- page view - per-collection refresh cost is the early warning for the rollup
-- falling behind.
--
-- Every row of the collection is upserted in the loop iteration being timed, so
-- dropping the timestamp predicate stamps exactly the rows the duration
-- describes. Only the UPDATE's WHERE clause changes; nothing else in the
-- function is touched.
--
-- REVERT: restore `AND computed_at >= v_t0` on that UPDATE (and duration_ms
-- goes back to NULL forever).
