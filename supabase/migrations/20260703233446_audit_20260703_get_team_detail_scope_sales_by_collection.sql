-- Bug 5: /nba-top-shot/team/<big-team> 404s. get_team_detail() runs under its own
-- statement_timeout=8s; for large Top Shot franchises (e.g. Portland Trail Blazers,
-- 436 editions) the 30d-activity block took ~20s (full scan of the recent sales
-- slice joined to editions filtered only by e.collection_id) -> 8s timeout -> the
-- route maps the error to null -> notFound() -> 404. Small NFL teams finish under
-- 8s so they render, which is why the bug looked Top-Shot-specific.
--
-- Fix: add `s.collection_id = p_collection_id` to the 30d-activity query. sales
-- carries an authoritative collection_id (same value reached via the edition join),
-- so this is provably result-identical but lets the planner use the
-- sales_YYYY (collection_id, sold_at DESC) partition index. Measured 3,953ms -> 27ms.
-- No FMV/pricing/aggregate math changed. CREATE OR REPLACE preserves grants.
