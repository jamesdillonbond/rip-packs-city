-- ⛔ REVERTED the same morning by 20261004172500 (11.3 s -> 54.3 s through the function, past
-- its 50 s timeout). Kept because it is recorded in supabase_migrations; do not re-apply.
--
-- 2026-10-04 (PT) — backfill_pack_rip_metadata: the allday_repair leg reads the resolved All Day
-- packs once instead of probing allday_pack_pull per rip.
--
-- WHY. `backfill-pack-rip-metadata` (hourly at :53, 50 s statement_timeout) failed 5 of 24 runs on
-- 10-03/10-04, and its successful runs climbed 28.7 s (10-01) -> 40.7 s (10-04). Profiled read-only
-- at the production batch (2000): of ~10 s of candidate selection and pricing, the allday_repair
-- leg was 8.5 s / 2.18 M buffers. It walks idx_pack_rips_unvalued_stamped in stamp order and probes
-- allday_pack_pull twice per row to find 200 rips with pull rows and none unresolved. 435,860 All
-- Day rips sit ahead of them: most have no pull rows, so they are never selected, never re-stamped,
-- and never leave the head. That is the "ORDER BY decides whether a leg progresses" class. Only
-- 568 rips qualify at all.
--
-- WHAT. One new CTE, allday_priceable (pack_nft_ids with pull rows minus those with an unresolved
-- pull), read once and hash-joined. The same set by definition; measured on production, 568 = 568
-- with 0 differences either way. The ORDER BY, LIMIT, every other leg and the UPDATE are
-- untouched. Warm: 2.18 M -> 228 k buffers, ~8.5 s -> 2.2 s for the leg.
-- Whole-function timings (rollback DO block): see the ledger entry of 2026-10-04.
-- anon-exec: unchanged (backfill_pack_rip_metadata) — CREATE OR REPLACE of an existing fn; ACL preserved.
--
-- Revert: re-apply the body from
--   supabase/migrations/20260924123824_audit_20260924_pack_dist_vote_fills_never_overwrites_and_identity_relabel.sql
