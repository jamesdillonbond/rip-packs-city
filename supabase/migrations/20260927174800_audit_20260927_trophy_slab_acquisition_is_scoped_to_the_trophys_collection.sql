-- audit_20260927_trophy_slab_acquisition_is_scoped_to_the_trophys_collection
--
-- get_trophy_slab_data read a trophy's acquired_price / acquisition_method from
-- moment_acquisitions by nft_id ALONE. A moment_id is unique only WITHIN a
-- collection (CLAUDE.md #142): Top Shot and Pinnacle ids are both numeric, and
-- on 2026-09-27 55 nft_ids already appear under more than one collection_id in
-- moment_acquisitions (1,068,810 rows, 0 with a NULL collection_id). A trophy
-- whose id collided would have shown another collection's purchase as its cost.
-- Today 0 of the 22 pinned trophies collide, and all 7 that have an
-- acquisition keep it under the scoped read (7/7) — so this changes no live
-- output; it closes the class before a Pinnacle or Candy pin meets it.
--
-- Change: both acquisition subqueries add `AND ma.collection_id = tm.collection_id`.
-- Everything else is byte-identical to the live body (prosrc normalised md5
-- 24e84d64be33917b25fdf0308faa12d7 = the pin in supabase/tests/get_trophy_slab_data.sql,
-- verified before writing).
--
-- Revert: re-apply the body in
-- supabase/migrations/20260913040000_audit_20260913_trophy_art_falls_back_to_the_live_edition_render.sql.
