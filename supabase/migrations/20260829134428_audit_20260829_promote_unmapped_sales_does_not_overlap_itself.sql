-- audit_20260829_promote_unmapped_sales_does_not_overlap_itself
--
-- 🚨 `promote_unmapped_sales` RUNS CONCURRENTLY WITH ITSELF ON A QUARTER OF ITS RUNS, AND EVERY
-- OVERLAP IS 100% DUPLICATED WORK.
--
-- Found live at 2026-08-29 13:21Z: `pg_stat_activity` showed TWO instances active at once, one at
-- **281 seconds**, both in `IO DataFileRead`, alongside 30 of 36 backends in IO wait.
--
-- ── WHY AN OVERLAP IS WASTE RATHER THAN A BUG ──────────────────────────────
-- The `candidates` CTE is `WHERE us.resolved_at IS NULL ... LIMIT 1000` with **no
-- `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and no in-flight marker**, so two instances select the SAME rows.
-- The write path is idempotent (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, and `mark_done` re-checks
-- `us.resolved_at IS NULL`), so nothing is corrupted — the second instance simply repeats the
-- entire scan and then classifies the rows the first one inserted as `already_in_sales`.
--
-- ── MEASURED, 24 h to 2026-08-29 13:25Z, from `pipeline_runs` ───────────────
--   307 runs · avg gap between starts **278 s** · p50 10,711 ms · p95 **196,353 ms** · max 297,164 ms
--   **76 runs (24.8%) were still executing when the next run started.**
-- Split by collection — and the split is what decides the lock key:
--   nfl_all_day      229 runs · avg **65,864 ms** · max 297,164 ms · **74 same-slug overlaps**
--   laliga_golazos    78 runs · avg **959 ms**    · max   6,323 ms · **0 overlaps**
-- ⚠ A function-wide lock would make Golazos — which never overlaps and finishes in under a
-- second — queue behind an AllDay run that averages 66 seconds, for no benefit. **The key is
-- scoped to `p_collection_id`, which covers 74 of the 76 observed overlaps.**
--
-- ⚠ `SET statement_timeout = '300s'` on this function is why a run can reach 297 s at all: over
-- PostgREST a HIGHER declaration RAISES the bound above the role's. The Supabase gateway caps
-- that path at ~120 s, so **a run past two minutes has no client left to receive it and burns IO
-- for up to three more**. That declaration is NOT changed here — it is load-bearing for the
-- legitimate long runs — but it is the reason overlaps are long enough to matter.
--
-- ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, STATED PLAINLY ─────────────────────────────────
-- ⛔ The scan itself. AllDay carries **104,913 permanently unresolved rows** and every run
-- re-evaluates the four resolution paths across them to promote **~1.5 sales an hour** — roughly
-- **four hours of database time a day** at the observed cadence. ⚠ And `ok` stays TRUE
-- throughout, because the honest-signal guard is `IF v_eligible > 0 AND v_promoted = 0 ...`,
-- which cannot fire when `eligible` is 0 or 1. **This migration removes the duplicate quarter of
-- that cost and nothing else.** The cadence and the backlog are filed separately — they need a
-- decision about whether an every-4.6-minute call from `allday-sales-indexer`'s `finally` block
-- is justified when pg_cron jobid 215 already covers the same ground hourly.
--
-- ⚠ `_xact_` is required, not stylistic: Supabase pools connections, so a leaked SESSION-level
-- advisory lock would be inherited by an unrelated later request and wedge this drain
-- permanently. A transaction-scoped lock is released on COMMIT/ROLLBACK on every path, including
-- a `statement_timeout` kill — which this function reaches often.
--
-- ⚠ `SECURITY DEFINER`, `SET search_path = public`, `SET statement_timeout = '300s'`, both
-- parameter defaults and the `jsonb` return type are restated VERBATIM; the body is otherwise
-- byte-identical to 20260731190000, verified before editing by normalising both and comparing
-- md5 (`146cd31ded32d5a1db3d554ef428904e`, length 9,031, live prosrc == committed migration).
-- anon-exec: unchanged (promote_unmapped_sales) -- CREATE OR REPLACE does not touch the ACL;
-- verified anon=false, authenticated=false, service_role=true before and after.
--
-- REVERT: re-create the function without the `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` block at the top of
-- BEGIN (everything from the CONCURRENCY GUARD comment to its `END IF;`). Nothing else differs;
-- no data is written or destroyed.
--
-- EXIT CONDITION: same-slug overlaps for `nfl_all_day` fall from 74/day toward 0, replaced by
-- `skipped_concurrent_run` rows on the same cadence, and total `promote_unmapped_sales` database
-- time falls by roughly a quarter.
-- FALSIFIER: if overlaps persist, the second instance is NOT another `promote_unmapped_sales` —
-- re-read `pg_stat_activity` for what actually shares the window before changing anything else.
