// SECOND coverage gate — React components / client pages.
//
// The primary vitest.config.ts measures ONLY lib/** + app/api/**/route.ts, so
// the ~429 component/page .tsx files contribute nothing to that ratchet and
// their coverage could silently rot (or new untested financial UI could land)
// with nothing to catch it. This config gates the component layer separately,
// at its own (lower) threshold, so component coverage can only go UP.
//
// It runs the SAME jsdom-tagged suites (__tests__/**/*.test.tsx) the main run
// already executes, but scopes the coverage `include` to the component tree.
// CI job `component-tests` runs `npm run test:coverage:components`.
